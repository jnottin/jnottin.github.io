Ideas:
    PRIMARY:
        - NAV BAR - invisble bar but fixed - https://pierre.io/
        - NAME ANIMATION - Have my name roll up like a drop up menu see - http://dejan.works/
        - APP IMAGES HOVER BUTTON - hover over images and button appear to send to deployed app -- see http://mattfarley.ca/ for reference
        - SIDE BUTTONS THAT EXPAND - fixed at bottom or top with email, github, linkedin, etc info - https://caferati.me/
        - TECHNOLOGIES USED - place description of technologies used for your app below each picture
        - ABOUT ME - about me section below my name with basic  bio, brand statement,
